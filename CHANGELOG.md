## [5.1.0] - 2015-01-11
### Changed

### Changed

## [4.0.0] - 2014-06-30
### Added
- Ability to cycle through all unoccupied ports on your target. No more need to right-click a port!
- Ports can now be targeted up to 2.25 Km away!
- When a vessel is first targeted, the nearest port is automatically targeted.
- Magenta HUD indicator floats on top of currently targeted port to allow for easy identification.
- Ability to rename all docking ports using the right-click GUI (in both VAB/SPH and flight).
- Text readout on indicator which displays the name of the targeted port.
- Closure Distance (CDST) readout, displays range to target port along the approach axis only.
- Prograde icon on velocity vector changes to Retrograde icon when CVEL is negative.
- Support for parts with multiple docking ports (Thanks taniwha!)
- Support for Extraplanetary Launchpads' recycle bins (Thanks taniwha!)
### Changed
- New toolbar button icon, easier to identify. Button will show/hide indicator.
- Removed hard-dependency on Blizzy's Toolbar
- Added custom 'toolbar' button if Blizzy's toolbar is not present.
- Text now drawn using Bitmap Fonts, allowing for higher resolution text.
### Fixed
- Indicator no longer displayed in Map View or while on EVA
- Generalized port orientation logic - non-stock lateral ports should now work (Thanks taniwha!)


## [3.0]
### Added
- Indicator's size can now be scaled freely (from settings window)
- Toolbar-Plugin miniature icon for toggling the settings window
- Glyph Font rendering to support indicator scaling
### Changed
- Verified compatibility with KSP v0.23
### Fixed
- Indicator will now display at full resolution regardless of KSP's Texture Settings


## [2.2]
### Changed
- Verified compatibility with KSP v0.22
- Roll degrees now range from 0-359.9 (was -180 to +180 before)
### Fixed
- Stock lateral docking ports (Inline Clampotron) now orient correctly!
- Settings window toggle-buttons now much more visible


## [2.1]
### Changed
- Velocity Indicator now draws on top of of Alignment Vector.
- Reduced sensitivity of alignment indicator near center of the gauge slightly.
- Removed forward velocity component of the velocity vector. Now full deflection always indicates 3.5 m/s of lateral velocity.
- Added slight exponential scaling to velocity vector near center of gauge.
- Velocity Indicator will display as a 'retrograde' vector when your alignment is greater than 90 degrees off-axis, indicating that translation controls have a reversed impact on the movement of the visual indicator. Moving the indicator towards the green cross will still bring you towards centerline.
### Fixed
- A bug that caused the velocity vector to behave incorrectly in certain circumstances [thanks Mr Shifty].
- CVEL now measures velocity along the target port's normal vector (intended behavior), not true velocity.
- Negated CVEL value when passing into back-hemisphere (red CDI region). Closure is now always a positive value.


## [2.0]
### Added
- Course Deviation Indicators (CDI)
- Translational Velocity vector
- Closure velocity and distance readouts
- settings menu
- Increased precision of alignment indicator with exponential scaling
### Changed
- Enhanced precision of roll indicator
- Retouched all graphics


## [1.0]
### Added
- First Release
